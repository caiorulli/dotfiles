My dotfiles! An outrageous amount of time was wasted here. Feel free to browse it, and check out if there's anything useful for your own configuration.

Managed by [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager). I might end up adding more Nix stuff here as I progress in the Nix rabbit hole.
